# banana_app

Banana App is a Flutter application for scanning banana leaves using your device's camera and AI-powered disease detection. The app allows users to:

- Capture banana leaf images using the camera
- Run real-time or photo-based disease detection using YOLO models
- View detection results with confidence scores
- Save scan history and view previous results
- Manage and reset local scan database

This project demonstrates integration of camera, machine learning inference, and local SQLite storage in Flutter. It is designed for agricultural and plant health monitoring use cases, but can be adapted for other object detection tasks.
